ü§ñ Machine Learning Projects Repository
Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This collection showcases end-to-end projects that solve real-world problems using data-driven methods. From predicting healthcare risks to estimating flight prices and forecasting restaurant sales, these projects demonstrate how machine learning can optimize operations and support strategic decision-making.

üöÄ Projects Overview
‚úàÔ∏è 1. Flight Price Prediction
View Project
Objective: To predict the price of flight tickets based on key features like airline, source, destination, date of journey, duration, and number of stops.
Key Features:

Extensive data preprocessing including feature extraction from dates and times

One-hot and label encoding for categorical variables

Feature importance analysis to understand price-driving factors

Model training using Random Forest and XGBoost Regressors

Evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R¬≤ score

Use case: Helps travel agencies and users make cost-effective decisions

üçΩÔ∏è 2. Forecasting Restaurant Sales
View Project
Objective: To forecast daily/weekly restaurant sales based on historical data, weather, holidays, and promotional campaigns.
Key Features:

Time series decomposition and seasonality analysis

Feature engineering (e.g., day of week, is holiday, promo flags)

Modeling using ARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost for hybrid forecasting

Evaluation using MAE, MAPE, RMSE

Visualizations of forecast accuracy vs actuals

Use case: Enables restaurant chains to plan inventory and staffing efficiently

‚ù§Ô∏è 3. Heart Disease Prediction
View Project
Objective: To predict the risk of heart disease in patients using clinical and demographic data with classification models.
Key Features:
